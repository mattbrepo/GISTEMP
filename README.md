# GISTEMP
Plotting [GISTEMP](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/) data using [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) library.

**Language: HTML / Javascript / D3**

**Start: 2019**

## Why
I have wanted to try out D3.js for a long time. Gave it a go using the NASA's GISTEMP data.

To try it out download both .csv and .html files.

## Example
